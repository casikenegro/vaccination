## Can I use docker? ðŸ˜Ž

We got your back, the project already uses docker so you can build docker image 
1.  Clone this repo
2.  Copy the  `.env.example`  file over to your own  `.env`  file and update the variables
3.  Run  `docker-compose up -d`  to setup local environment with Docker


This setup will handle hot reloading, so any updates you make to the NestJS code will update the container in realtime.
